		<h1>Hello world!</h1>
		<p>Welcome to my Github Pages site!</p>
		<p>This is my CS journey, documented.</p>
		<div>
			<h2>Some things about me:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>I love Death Grips. I was introduced to them by my girlfriend.</li>
				<li>I first thought I could get into CS after making a cool looking website on neocities! <a href="https://filmydidi.neocities.org">(here it is, very WIP though! never completed, got superceded by this website.)</a></li>
				<li>That is all for now. I will add more as I think of it, but honestly, right now this is just a page for myself.</li>
